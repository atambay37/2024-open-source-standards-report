%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%  Welcome to the Patterns LaTeX template 2.0
%%%  derived from the Cell Press template,     
%%%  version 1.8. This is a minimalist template    
%%%  to help you organize your article for            
%%%  publication at Cell Press. PLEASE NOTE:

%%%  (1) If you submit your final manuscript materials 
%%%  in LaTeX format, our typesetters will prepare 
%%%  a Word file for use in production. This conversion 
%%%  process allows us to copyedit your paper, fix 
%%%  any typos, and add formatting and tagging. The 
%%%  conversion process will add approximately 3 
%%%  business days to the production timeline. 
%%%  Authors using LaTeX should keep this in mind 
%%%  when considering deadlines.

%%%  (2) Keep your LaTeX files as simple as possible. 
%%%  Avoid the use of elaborate local macros and/or 
%%%  customized external style files. If you need 
%%%  additional macros, please keep them simple and 
%%%  include them in the actual .tex document preamble. 
%%%  Source code should be set up so that all .sty 
%%%  and .bst files called by the main .tex file are 
%%%  in the same directory as the main .tex file. 

%%%  (3) Cell Press publishes more than 40 journals, 
%%%  some of which may have different or additional 
%%%  formatting requirements not specified in this 
%%%  template. When revising your paper before 
%%%  acceptance, please review the formatting 
%%%  guidelines, including the Final Files Requirements, 
%%%  for the journal you are publishing with.

%%%  Please send feedback on this template to patterns@cell.com.

\maketitle

\section*{SUMMARY}

The summary (abstract) should consist of a single paragraph of 150 words or fewer.

\section*{KEYWORDS}

%%%  Include up to 10 keywords, separated by commas. 
%%%  Keywords entered in EM are not carried over; only 
%%%  keywords included in the main text will be used 
%%%  in the final article metadata.    

cell, press, LaTeX, template 

\section*{INTRODUCTION}

No subheadings, please. Use of abbreviations should be kept to a minimum, and nonstandard abbreviations should be defined when first used in the text.

\section*{RESULTS}

The results may be divided with subheadings. Please do not use numbered subheadings. For some formats, ``results and discussion" may be combined under a single heading. 

\subsection*{Figures}

For initial submissions, figures and their titles and legends can be run-in with the text. For final submissions, the image files must be uploaded as separate files, one complete file per figure. The figure titles and legends should be placed toward the end of the main text, after the declaration of interests. Our typesetters will place the figures and their titles and legends appropriately based on your in-text citations.

\subsection*{Citations}

To cite/link to display items (figures and tables) and/or sections of the manuscript, simply write, for example, ``(Figure 1)" or ``see discussion." Our team will do the rest. Please note that we do not number sections or subsections.

To cite references, you may use the cite command, e.g., ``Recent articles in \textit{Matter} and \textit{Cell} \cite{wang2020conformational,li2020conformational}  have shown ..." or  ``Many interesting discoveries have been reported, \cite{wang2020conformational,radzihovsky1995new,cates1984statics,kapoor2022leakage,hantke2018my} which ..." 

\subsection*{Equations}

Simple formulae should appear in line with the text whenever possible. You can write inline math by enclosing it between \verb|\(| and \verb|\)|, as in this example: \(x^2 + y^2 = z^2\). You can also enclose it between dollar signs (\texttt{\$}), as in this example: $E=mc^2$.

Larger, more complex formulae may appear on a new line, either by enclosing them between \verb|\[| and \verb|\]| or by using the \verb|displaymath| environment:

\[ x^n + y^n = z^n \]

\begin{displaymath}
\sqrt{x^2+1}
\end{displaymath}

If any equations or formulae need to be referred to or cited again later in the text, use the \verb|equation| environment to number them. Later, you can cite these as "Equation 1," "Equation 2," etc.

\begin{equation}
f(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \frac{a_i}{1+x}
\end{equation}

\section*{DISCUSSION}

The discussion should explain the significance of the results and place them into a broader context. Subheadings are permitted.

\subsection*{Limitations of the study}

A "limitations" or "limitations of the study" subsection in the discussion is encouraged.

\section*{METHODS}

\subsection*{Custom methods subheading 1}
\subsection*{Custom methods subheading 2}

%%%  The methods section usually appears 
%%%  immediately after the discussion section,
%%%  but may be moved elsewhere at the author's 
%%%  discretion, subject to editor approval. 

\section*{RESOURCE AVAILABILITY}

%%%  The resource availability section is required 
%%%  for all research articles. It is the first 
%%%  section that should appear under the "experimental 
%%%  procedures" heading. This section must contain 
%%%  the following required subsections: "lead contact," 
%%%  "materials availability," and "data and code 
%%%  availability." These 3 subsections are mandatory 
%%%  even if no unique materials were generated in 
%%%  the study. Do not edit or change the names of 
%%%  the (sub)headings. No other subheadings or text 
%%%  are allowed in the resource availability section.

\subsection*{Lead contact}

%%%  Authors are required to designate a lead contact, 
%%%  who will be responsible for communication with 
%%%  the journal before and after publication and is 
%%%  the arbiter of disputes, including concerns 
%%%  related to reagents or resource sharing. Only 
%%%  one author can be named the lead contact, and 
%%%  only the lead contact’s information may be 
%%%  provided in this section.

Requests for further information and resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by the lead contact, Sally White (s.white@university.edu).

\subsection*{Materials availability}

%%%  This subsection must include a statement describing 
%%%  the availability of newly generated materials 
%%%  associated with the paper, including any conditions 
%%%  for access. If there are no newly generated materials 
%%%  associated with the paper, the statement should 
%%%  state this, e.g.: This study did not generate new 
%%%  materials.

Plasmids generated in this study have been deposited to [Addgene, name and catalog number or unique identifier].

\subsection*{Data and code availability}

%%%  All original research papers must include a 
%%%  comprehensive and accurate “data and code 
%%%  availability” statement within the “resource 
%%%  availability” section of the paper before it 
%%%  is accepted for publication. 

Our source code is available at GitHub (LINK) and has been archived at Zenodo\cite{georgios_rizos_2023_10253149}. Any additional information required to reanalyze the data reported in this paper is available from the lead contact upon request.

\section*{MAIN FIGURE TITLES AND LEGENDS}

%%%  At final submission, figure files MUST be 
%%%  provided separately as high-resolution image 
%%%  files. All of the panels for a figure should 
%%%  be in the same file. Figures should have 
%%%  clear labels/file names (Figure 1, Figure 2, 
%%%  etc.). 

%%%  Figure titles and legends should be placed 
%%%  at the end of the main text. You do not 
%%%  need to place the figures, nor their titles 
%%%  and legends, within the main text. While 
%%%  typesetting your article, our team will 
%%%  place each figure in the best location 
%%%  based on the final layout and on your 
%%%  figure citations, e.g., (Figures 1A and 1B). 

%%%  Please review the figure guidelines before 
%%%  submitting your final materials: 
%%%  https://www.cell.com/figureguidelines.

\subsection*{Figure 1. A brief title that describes the entire figure without citing specific panels}

The figure legend can be all one paragraph and describe the images (A), graphs (B), and plots (C), etc., together.
\newline
(A) Or each panel or group of panels can be described separately, as shown here and below.
\newline
(B) Graph of X, Y, and Z.
\newline
(C and D) If panels are grouped like this, please explicitly describe each panel, e.g., “Images showing SEM (C) and TEM (D).”
\newline
Please define all scale and error bars, and please review the Cell Press figure guidelines before submission: \href{https://www.cell.com/figureguidelines}{https://www.cell.com/figureguidelines}. Example figure created by Cassie Comeau, Cell Press.

\section*{MAIN TABLES, INCLUDING TITLES AND LEGENDS}

%%%  Whenever possible, we encourage you to submit 
%%%  your main-text tables as Microsoft Word documents, 
%%%  using Word's table function. This will ensure 
%%%  the best results during conversion. Tables 
%%%  should be numbered Table 1, Table 2, etc. and 
%%%  should not include subpanels (do not use Table 1A, 
%%%  1B, etc.). Give each table a brief descriptive 
%%%  title. Table legends are optional but encouraged. 
%%%  Footnotes (superscript lowercase letters) should 
%%%  be used where necessary to indicate some feature 
%%%  of the data; please do not use bold, italic, 
%%%  colored text, or shading for this purpose. Use 
%%%  separate cells, not line breaks or spaces, for 
%%%  all discrete data elements. Small embedded 
%%%  graphics with color are OK.

%%%  Like figures, all tables must be cited within 
%%%  the main text, and our typesetting team will 
%%%  place the tables within the typeset paper at 
%%%  the appropriate locations.


\subsection*{Table 1. A table with clear organization of data}

\begin{tabular}{|l | l | l | l|} 
 \hline
 \textbf{Column 1} & \textbf{Column 2} & \textbf{Column 3} & \textbf{Column 4} \\ [1ex] 
 \hline
 Row A\textsuperscript{a} & 6 & 87,837 & 787 \\ [1ex] 
 \hline
 Row B & 7 & 78 & 5,415 \\ [1ex] 
 \hline
 Row C & 545 & 778 & 7507 \\ [1ex] 
 \hline
 Row D & 545 & 18,744 & 7,560 \\ [1ex] 
 \hline
 Row E & 88 & 788 & 6,344 \\ [1ex] 
 \hline
\end{tabular}

\bigskip

The table legend (optional) follows the table itself. The legend should be used to provide additional info that relates to the table as a whole.

\textsuperscript{a}Footnotes can be used to provide additional info on specific content within the table, such as this footnote to the first row (row A). Do not use footnotes in the table title.
